# shipmyfix
Amendments:
Implementation:
- Add a global state management and dependency injection, like Provider.
- Localization.
- Generic components extraction.
Features: 
- owner should either have a default ship or choose from a list of ships before listing ship parts (would make it easier for repair shops to bid on a part that has more details)
- sync with device calendar when picking a repair date (and after the shops bid) - to exclude certain dates
